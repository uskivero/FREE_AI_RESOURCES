Free Adobe Illustrator Resources

A list of FREE Adobe Illustrator resources from around the web

- These are a mix of ready to use, base vectors as well as pattern, art, scatter etc (meaning I haven't really organized anything yet)
- Some are just a straight download, some are pay what you want and some require email and/or sign-up 
- Please make sure to consult the licences as these are mix of personal, CC 4.0 and commercial use assets 

Cheers!
